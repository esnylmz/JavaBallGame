#### JavaBallGame

Java GUI Arcade Game (Personal Project)
Object-Oriented Programming with Java â€“ 2022

Developed a 2D interactive game using Java Swing and AWT, featuring moving elements (ball & droplet), score/life tracking, and collision detection.

Implemented real-time animation using Timer, handled user interaction via mouse clicks, and designed a functional menu system (Start, Pause, Exit).

Applied object-oriented principles to structure reusable game components (Ball, Droplet) and encapsulate game logic.
